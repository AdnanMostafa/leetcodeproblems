- Focus first on the __Edge cases__ and the __constraints__ of the problem.
        
- For languages like **Java**, array is a **static structure** whereas for languages like **Python** and **Javascript** it is **dynamic** in usage.

- **Stream reduce** functions in Java or **Array reduce** functions in Javascript can be used to calculate the sum of the final elements in the resulting array.

- If using **while loops**, make sure to think of __infinite loops__
        
- Since the question is not clear immediately, something that works is asking the right questions to the interviewer
    - Looking and asking for examples is perfectly valid.
    - Just going with the math initially if we are not able to simplify the problem makes sense as well.
        - Eg: here nums[2*i] and nums[2*i+1] are being asked which could be used in the loop as it is.
    
- Should focus on the input and the output expected before hand and think about conversions if needed.
    - Stream converstion and .toArray() functions can be used to simplify looping and converting the List to array to meet the output contract.
